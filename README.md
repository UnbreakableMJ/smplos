## What is smplOS?

smplOS is a minimal Arch Linux distribution built around one idea: **simplicity**.

It draws inspiration from projects like [Omarchy](https://omakub.org/) but takes a different path. Where others ship opinions, smplOS ships sensible defaults that stay out of your way. No bloat, no decisions made for you — just a clean, fast, good-looking system that works the moment you boot it.

### Why smplOS?

- **Lightweight.** Under 850 MB of RAM on a cold boot. Every package earns its place.
- **Fast installs.** Fully offline — no internet required. A fresh install completes in under 2 minutes.
- **Cross-compositor.** Built from the ground up to support multiple compositors. Hyprland (Wayland) ships first, DWM (X11) is next. Shared configs, shared themes, shared keybindings — the compositor is just a thin layer.
- **One UI toolkit.** EWW powers the bar, widgets, and dialogs. It runs on both X11 and Wayland. No waybar, no polybar, no redundant tools.
- **14 built-in themes.** One command switches colors across the entire system — terminal, bar, notifications, borders, lock screen, and editor.

### Design Decisions

Every tool in smplOS was chosen to work across compositors — Wayland and X11 — so the OS feels identical regardless of which one you run.

| Component | Choice | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Bar & widgets** | EWW | GTK3-based — runs natively on both X11 and Wayland. One codebase for bar, launcher, theme picker, and keybind help. Replaces waybar, polybar, and rofi. |
| **Launcher** | Rofi | Wayland fork (lbonn/rofi) and X11 original share the same config format and theming. One theme file, two backends. |
| **Terminal** | st / st-wl | Suckless st has an X11 build and a Wayland port (marchaesen/st-wl). Same config.h, same patches, same look. Starts in ~5ms and uses ~4 MB of RAM — critical for staying under the 850 MB cold-boot target. |
| **Notifications** | Dunst | Works on both X11 and Wayland with the same config. Lightweight, themeable, no dependencies on a specific compositor. |

The rule is simple: if a tool only works on one display server, it doesn't ship in `src/shared/`. Compositor-specific code stays in `src/compositors/<name>/` and is kept as thin as possible.

### Editions

smplOS ships in focused editions that **stack on top of each other**. Pick the ones you need — they all merge cleanly:

| Flag | Edition | Focus | Example apps |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `-p` | **Productivity** | Office & workflow | Logseq, LibreOffice, KeePassXC |
| `-c` | **Creators** | Design & media | GIMP, OBS, Kdenlive, Inkscape |
| `-m` | **Communication** | Chat & calls | Discord, Signal, Slack |
| `-d` | **Development** | Developer tools | Docker, lazygit, neovim extras |
| `-a` | **AI** | AI tools | Ollama, open-webui |

Build with any combination:

```bash
./build-iso.sh -p -d          # Productivity + Development
./build-iso.sh -p -d -c -m    # Stack all four
./build-iso.sh                 # Base only (browser, terminal, file manager)
```

Every edition installs offline, in under 2 minutes, from the same ISO.

## Getting Started

On first boot, a notification shows the essential keybindings. Here they are for reference:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| <kbd>Super</kbd> (tap) | Start menu launcher |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> | Terminal |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> | App launcher |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> | Close window |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> | Fullscreen |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> | Toggle floating |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>1-9</kbd> | Switch workspace |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> | Keybinding cheatsheet |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> | File manager |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> | Web browser |
| <kbd>Print</kbd> | Screenshot |
| <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Escape</kbd> | Power menu |

Press <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> anytime to see all bindings in an overlay.

### Themes

Switch the system theme (terminal, bar, borders, lock screen, editor) with a single command:

```bash
theme-set catppuccin     # or: dracula, nord, gruvbox, rose-pine, ...
```

Or open the theme picker from the start menu's Settings tab.

---

## Architecture

smplOS separates shared infrastructure from compositor-specific configuration. The goal is maximum code reuse — compositors are a thin layer on top of a shared foundation.

```
src/
  shared/              Everything here works on ALL compositors
    bin/               User-facing scripts (installed to /usr/local/bin/)
    eww/               EWW bar and widgets (GTK3 -- works on X11 + Wayland)
    configs/smplos/    Cross-compositor configs (bindings.conf, branding)
    themes/            14 themes with templates for all apps
    installer/         OS installer
    settings-panel/    System settings
  compositors/
    hyprland/          Hyprland-specific config (hypr/, st-wl terminal)
    dwm/               DWM-specific config (st terminal, future)
  editions/            Edition-specific package lists and post-install scripts
  builder/             ISO build pipeline
  iso/                 ISO resources (boot entries, offline repo)
release/               VM testing tools (dev-push, test-iso, QEMU scripts)
```

## Design Principles

- **Simple over opinionated.** Provide good defaults, not forced workflows.
- **Cross-compositor first.** Every feature must work across Hyprland (Wayland) and DWM (X11). Compositor-specific code stays in `src/compositors/<name>/`.
- **EWW is the UI layer.** Bar, widgets, dialogs — all EWW. It runs on both GTK3/X11 and GTK3/Wayland.
- **One theme system.** `theme-set` applies colors to EWW, terminals, btop, notifications, compositor borders, lock screen, and neovim.
- **bindings.conf is the single source of truth** for keybindings across all compositors.
- **Minimal packages.** One terminal, one launcher, one bar. No redundant tools.
- **Offline-first.** The ISO carries everything needed. No downloads during install.

## Compositors

| Compositor | Display Server | Terminal | Status |
|------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| Hyprland   | Wayland       | st-wl    | Active |
| DWM        | X11           | st       | Planned |

## Start Menu Launcher

smplOS includes a custom start menu launcher built on rofi, inspired by the [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) type-1/style-15 layout. It appears at the bottom-left of the screen (like a Plasma/Windows start menu) with a slide-left animation, blur, and per-theme transparency.

**Open it:** Press <kbd>Super</kbd> (tap and release) or click the logo in the EWW bar.

### Tabs

The launcher uses rofi's native modi system with two tabs:

| Tab | Hotkey | What it shows |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| **Apps** | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> | All desktop applications (drun) |
| **Settings** | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> | System settings entries (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Display, Audio, Themes, etc.) |

Hotkeys jump to the tab **and clear the search filter** — so you get a fresh list every time. The mode-switcher tabs at the bottom are also clickable.

### How it works

- **`launcher`** — wrapper script that runs rofi with native modi (`drun` + `settings:rofi-settings-src`). Handles <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> via `kb-custom` exit codes, restarting rofi on the target mode.
- **`rofi-settings-src`** — rofi script-mode source that reads from the app cache, filtering for settings entries.
- **`smplos-launcher.rasi.tpl`** — theme template with `rgba()` transparency using `popup_opacity` from `colors.toml`, matching the look of other popup panels.
- **Hyprland layerrules** — `animation slide left`, `blur on`, `ignore_alpha 0.1` on namespace `rofi`.

### App Cache

The launcher reads from a pre-built app index at `~/.cache/smplos/app_index`. This is automatically rebuilt by a systemd path unit (`smplos-app-cache.path`) whenever `.desktop` files, Flatpak apps, or AppImages change. You can also rebuild manually:

```bash
rebuild-app-cache
```

## GTK Theming & Credential Storage

smplOS configures the system so GTK dialogs (file pickers, VS Code popups, etc.) follow the dark/light theme automatically:

- **GTK settings.ini** — written during install for X11 fallback
- **dconf/GSettings** — written during install via `dbus-run-session` for Wayland (GTK on Wayland ignores `settings.ini`)
- **`theme-set`** — updates both `gsettings color-scheme` and `gtk-theme` on every theme switch

Credential storage (for VS Code, Brave, git, etc.) is fully configured:

- **gnome-keyring** — installed, started via Hyprland autostart, PAM-integrated for auto-unlock at login
- **VS Code argv.json** — pre-configured with `"password-store": "gnome-libsecret"` to eliminate the keyring detection dialog

## Notification Center

A custom notification center built with Rust and [Slint](https://slint.dev), accessible from the bell icon in the EWW bar. It reads dunst's notification history and displays cards with dynamic heights — long messages word-wrap naturally instead of being truncated.

**Open it:** Click the bell icon in the bar, or press <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>.

### Features

- **Dynamic card layout** — each notification card grows to fit its content. No fixed heights, no wasted space.
- **Word-wrapped body text** — long notification bodies wrap cleanly instead of being clipped with an ellipsis.
- **Double-click to open** — double-click any notification to launch the associated app. Uses the desktop entry from dunst metadata, with a fallback to the app name.
- **Actionable notifications** — well-known notifications (like "System Update") map to specific commands. Double-click the System Update notification to open a full system update in your terminal.
- **Dismiss** — click the × button on any card to dismiss it.
- **Scrollable** — notifications overflow into a smooth-scrolling list.

### Architecture

```
dunst (notification daemon)
  └─ dunstctl history ──► notif-center (Rust + Slint)
                              ├─ Parses JSON history
                              ├─ Maps app names to nerd font icons
                              ├─ Maps summaries to actions (e.g. "System Update" → smplos-update)
                              └─ Renders scrollable card list via Slint UI
```

## System Updates

smplOS includes a built-in update system. On first boot, a persistent "System Update" notification appears. Double-click it in the notification center to run a full update, or run it manually:

```bash
smplos-update
```

The update script opens in your terminal and runs through:

1. **Pacman** — official repo packages (`pacman -Syu --noconfirm`)
2. **AUR** — if paru is installed, AUR packages (`paru -Sua --noconfirm`)
3. **Flatpak** — if Flatpak apps are installed (`flatpak update -y --noninteractive`)
4. **AppImages** — reminds you to check for updates manually

Terminal auto-detection ensures it works regardless of which terminal is installed: `xdg-terminal-exec` &#x2192; `st-wl` (Wayland) &#x2192; `st` (X11) &#x2192; `foot` &#x2192; `xterm`.

## Building

The build system is designed to work on **first run, on any Linux distro**. It runs inside a Docker container for reproducibility — your host system only needs Docker.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd src && ./build-iso.sh
```

This produces a bootable Arch Linux ISO in `release/`. First build takes ~15-20 minutes (downloads packages); subsequent same-day builds reuse the package cache and finish much faster.

### Prerequisites

The only hard requirement is **Docker**. If Docker isn't installed, the build script will detect your distro and offer to install it for you:

```
[WARN] Docker not found
Install Docker automatically? [Y/n]
```

If you prefer to install Docker yourself:

<details>
<summary><b>Arch / EndeavourOS / Manjaro / Garuda / CachyOS</b></summary>

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed docker
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for group to take effect
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Ubuntu / Debian / Pop!_OS / Linux Mint / Zorin</b></summary>

```bash
# Install prerequisites
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg

# Add Docker GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg \
    | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add Docker repo (use "ubuntu" or "debian" depending on your base)
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Fedora / Nobara</b></summary>

```bash
sudo dnf install -y docker
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>openSUSE</b></summary>

```bash
sudo zypper install -y docker
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Void Linux</b></summary>

```bash
sudo xbps-install -y docker
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/docker /var/service/
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
</details>

After installing Docker, **log out and back in** so the docker group takes effect. If you skip this, the build script will automatically fall back to `sudo docker`.

You also need **~10 GB of free disk space**. The script checks this and warns you if you're low.

### Build Options

```
Usage: build-iso.sh [OPTIONS]

Editions (stackable):
    -p, --productivity      Add Productivity edition (Logseq, LibreOffice, KeePassXC)
    -c, --creators          Add Creators edition (GIMP, OBS, Kdenlive, Inkscape)
    -m, --communication     Add Communication edition (Discord, Signal, Slack)
    -d, --development       Add Development edition (Docker, lazygit, neovim extras)
    -a, --ai                Add AI edition (Ollama, open-webui)

General:
    --compositor NAME       Compositor to build (hyprland, dwm) [default: hyprland]
    -r, --release           Release build: max xz compression (slow, smallest ISO)
    -n, --no-cache          Force fresh package downloads
    -v, --verbose           Verbose output
    --skip-aur              Skip AUR packages (faster, no Rust compilation)
    --skip-flatpak          Skip Flatpak packages
    --skip-appimage         Skip AppImages
    -h, --help              Show this help
```

#### Common Workflows

```bash
# Base build (Hyprland, browser, terminal, file manager)
./build-iso.sh

# Productivity + Development
./build-iso.sh -p -d

# Stack everything
./build-iso.sh -p -d -c -m -a

# Fast iteration build (skip AUR packages like EWW that take ages to compile)
./build-iso.sh --skip-aur

# Release build with max compression
./build-iso.sh -p -d --release

# Full verbose output for debugging
./build-iso.sh -v
```

### What the Build Does

1. **Checks prerequisites** — detects your distro, ensures Docker is installed and running, checks disk space.
2. **Builds AUR packages** (unless `--skip-aur`) — compiles packages like EWW in a temporary container. Results are cached in `src/iso/prebuilt/` so they only build once.
3. **Pulls `archlinux:latest`** — the build runs in a fresh Arch container for reproducibility.
4. **Downloads packages** — uses `pacman -Syw` to download all packages into a local mirror. On Arch-based hosts, your system's pacman cache is mounted read-only for instant hits.
5. **Builds the ISO** — copies configs, themes, scripts, and the offline package mirror into an Arch ISO profile, then runs `mkarchiso`.
6. **Outputs** — the final `.iso` lands in `release/`.

### Caching

Builds use a **dated cache** (`build_YYYY-MM-DD/`) under `.cache/`. Same-day rebuilds reuse downloaded packages. Old caches are automatically pruned (keeps the last 3 days). To force a completely fresh build:

```bash
./build-iso.sh --no-cache
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `permission denied` from Docker | Run `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, then log out and back in |
| DNS errors inside container | The build script passes `--dns 1.1.1.1 --dns 8.8.8.8` to work around systemd-resolved. If you still get DNS errors, check your firewall. |
| `no space left on device` | Need ~10 GB free. Also run `docker system prune` to reclaim Docker disk space. |
| AUR build fails | Try `--skip-aur` to skip it. Pre-built AUR packages are cached in `src/iso/prebuilt/`. |
| Slow builds | First build downloads ~2 GB of packages. After that, the cache makes rebuilds much faster. On Arch hosts, your system pacman cache is reused automatically. |

### Development Iteration

For config/script changes, avoid full ISO rebuilds:

```bash
# Host: push changes to VM shared folder
cd release && ./dev-push.sh eww    # or: bin, hypr, themes, all

# VM: apply changes to the live system
sudo bash /mnt/dev-apply.sh
```

### VM Testing

Use QEMU for testing — it provides a `virtio-gpu` device that Hyprland works with out of the box:

```bash
cd release && ./test-iso.sh
```

This launches a QEMU VM with KVM acceleration, UEFI firmware, a 20 GB virtual disk, and a 9p shared folder for live hot-reloading. The script auto-detects OVMF, finds the newest ISO in `release/`, and opens the VM window.

Once the VM boots, mount the shared folder to enable hot-reload:

```bash
# Inside the VM:
sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio hostshare /mnt
```

Then iterate without rebuilding the ISO:

```bash
# Host: push changes to the shared folder
cd release && ./dev-push.sh

# VM: apply them to the live system
sudo bash /mnt/dev-apply.sh
```

The 9p mount is live — `dev-push.sh` writes to `release/vmshare/` and changes are immediately visible inside the VM. No remount needed.

Use `--reset` to wipe the VM disk and start fresh:

```bash
./test-iso.sh --reset
```

> **VirtualBox is not supported.** Hyprland requires a working DRM/KMS device with OpenGL support. VirtualBox's virtual GPU (`VBoxVGA` / `VMSVGA`) does not provide this — Hyprland will crash immediately on startup, producing a "Couldn't wait for Hyprland. No child process" error from the login manager. This is a [known limitation](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/#running-in-a-vm) across all Hyprland-based distros, not a smplOS bug. Use QEMU with KVM (`test-iso.sh`) or VMware with 3D acceleration instead.

## Themes

14 built-in themes. Press <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open the theme picker and switch instantly.

Catppuccin Mocha, Catppuccin Latte, Ethereal, Everforest, Flexoki Light, Gruvbox, Hackerman, Kanagawa, Matte Black, Nord, Osaka Jade, Ristretto, Rose Pine, Tokyo Night.

One command -- `theme-set <name>` -- applies colors across the entire system: terminal, bar, notifications, compositor borders, lock screen, launcher, system monitor, editor, fish shell, Logseq, and browser chrome.

### How It Works

The theme system is a **build-time template pipeline** plus a **runtime switcher**:

```
colors.toml ──► generate-theme-configs.sh ──► 9 pre-baked configs per theme
                      (sed templates)
                                               theme-set copies them to
                                               their target locations and
                                               restarts/reloads each app
```

Each theme is a directory under `src/shared/themes/<name>/` containing:

| File | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `colors.toml` | Hand-authored | Single source of truth -- all colors and decoration variables |
| `btop.theme` | Generated | btop color scheme |
| `dunstrc.theme` | Generated | Dunst notification colors |
| `eww-colors.scss` | Generated | EWW bar/widget SCSS variables |
| `eww-colors.yuck` | Generated | EWW yuck variables (for SVG fills) |
| `fish.theme` | Generated | Fish shell syntax highlighting and pager colors |
| `foot.ini` | Generated | Foot terminal colors |
| `hyprland.conf` | Generated | Hyprland border colors, rounding, blur, opacity |
| `hyprlock.conf` | Generated | Lock screen colors |
| `logseq-custom.css` | Generated | Logseq editor colors (backgrounds, text, links, highlights) |
| `smplos-launcher.rasi` | Generated | Rofi start menu theme (rgba transparency via `popup_opacity`) |
| `neovim.lua` | Hand-authored | Lazy.nvim colorscheme spec |
| `vscode.json` | Hand-authored | VS Code/Codium/Cursor theme name + extension ID |
| `icons.theme` | Hand-authored | GTK icon theme name |
| `light.mode` | Hand-authored (optional) | Marker file -- if present, GTK + browser use light mode |
| `tide.theme` | Hand-authored | Tide prompt colors (git, pwd, vi-mode segments) |
| `backgrounds/` | Hand-authored | Wallpapers bundled with the theme |
| `preview.png` | Hand-authored | Theme preview screenshot for the picker |

### colors.toml Reference

Every theme defines all its values in a single `colors.toml` file. Here's the full set of variables:

#### Colors

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `accent` | Primary accent color (bar icons, active borders, highlights) | `"#89b4fa"` |
| `cursor` | Terminal cursor color | `"#f5e0dc"` |
| `foreground` | Default text color | `"#cdd6f4"` |
| `background` | Window/terminal background | `"#1e1e2e"` |
| `selection_foreground` | Text color in selections | `"#1e1e2e"` |
| `selection_background` | Background color of selections | `"#f5e0dc"` |
| `color0` - `color15` | Standard 16-color terminal palette | `"#45475a"` |

> **Note:** `color7` and `color15` are the colors terminals actually display for normal text in most shells. If terminal text looks dim, brighten these to match `foreground`.

#### Decoration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `rounding` | `"10"` | Window corner radius in pixels |
| `blur_size` | `"6"` | Background blur kernel size |
| `blur_passes` | `"3"` | Number of blur passes (higher = smoother, more GPU) |
| `opacity_active` | `"0.92"` | Opacity of focused windows (0.0 - 1.0) |
| `opacity_inactive` | `"0.85"` | Opacity of unfocused windows |
| `term_opacity_active` | `"1.0"` | Opacity of focused terminal windows |
| `term_opacity_inactive` | `"1.0"` | Opacity of unfocused terminal windows |
| `popup_opacity` | `"0.60"` | Opacity of EWW popups (calendar, etc.) |

Terminal opacity is separated from general window opacity so themes can give terminals a frosted-glass look while keeping other apps more opaque (or vice versa).

#### Example: Catppuccin Mocha

```toml
accent = "#89b4fa"
cursor = "#f5e0dc"
foreground = "#cdd6f4"
background = "#1e1e2e"
selection_foreground = "#1e1e2e"
selection_background = "#f5e0dc"

color0 = "#45475a"
color1 = "#f38ba8"
color2 = "#a6e3a1"
color3 = "#f9e2af"
color4 = "#89b4fa"
color5 = "#f5c2e7"
color6 = "#94e2d5"
color7 = "#cdd6f4"
color8 = "#585b70"
color9 = "#f38ba8"
color10 = "#a6e3a1"
color11 = "#f9e2af"
color12 = "#89b4fa"
color13 = "#f5c2e7"
color14 = "#94e2d5"
color15 = "#cdd6f4"

rounding = "12"
blur_size = "14"
blur_passes = "3"
opacity_active = "0.60"
opacity_inactive = "0.50"
term_opacity_active = "1.0"
term_opacity_inactive = "1.0"
popup_opacity = "0.40"
```

### Template System

Templates live in `src/shared/themes/_templates/` and use `{{ variable }}` placeholders.

The generator provides three variants of each color variable:

| Variant | Example input | Output | Use case |
|---------|--------------|--------|----------|
| `{{ accent }}` | `"#89b4fa"` | `#89b4fa` | CSS, config files |
| `{{ accent_strip }}` | `"#89b4fa"` | `89b4fa` | Hyprland `rgb()`, btop, foot |
| `{{ accent_rgb }}` | `"#89b4fa"` | `137,180,250` | Hyprlock `rgba()` |

### Creating a New Theme

1. **Create the directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir src/shared/themes/my-theme
   ```

2. **Write `colors.toml`** with all color and decoration values. Copy an existing theme as a starting point:
   ```bash
   cp src/shared/themes/catppuccin/colors.toml src/shared/themes/my-theme/
   ```

3. **Add optional hand-authored files:**
   - `neovim.lua` -- Lazy.nvim colorscheme plugin spec
   - `vscode.json` -- `{"name": "Theme Name", "extension": "publisher.extension-id"}`
   - `icons.theme` -- GTK icon theme name (e.g., `Papirus-Dark`)
   - `light.mode` -- Create this empty file if the theme is light
   - `backgrounds/` -- Add wallpapers (named `1-name.png`, `2-name.png`, etc.)
   - `preview.png` -- Screenshot for the theme picker

4. **Generate configs:**
   ```bash
   cd src && bash generate-theme-configs.sh
   ```
   This reads your `colors.toml`, expands all 9 templates, and writes the results into your theme directory.

5. **Test it:**
   ```bash
   theme-set my-theme
   ```

### What theme-set Does

When you run `theme-set <name>`, it:

1. Resolves the theme (user themes in `~/.config/smplos/themes/` take precedence over stock themes)
2. Atomically swaps the active theme directory at `~/.config/smplos/current/theme/`
3. Copies pre-baked configs to their target locations:
   - `eww-colors.scss` &#x2192; `~/.config/eww/theme-colors.scss`
   - `hyprland.conf` &#x2192; `~/.config/hypr/theme.conf`
   - `hyprlock.conf` &#x2192; `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock-theme.conf`
   - `foot.ini` &#x2192; `~/.config/foot/theme.ini`
   - `btop.theme` &#x2192; `~/.config/btop/themes/current.theme`
   - `fish.theme` &#x2192; `~/.config/fish/theme.fish`
   - `tide.theme` &#x2192; applied via `fish -c "source ...; tide reload"`
   - `logseq-custom.css` &#x2192; `~/.logseq/config/custom.css` + plugin theme via `preferences.json`
   - `smplos-launcher.rasi` &#x2192; `~/.config/rofi/smplos-launcher.rasi`
   - `dunstrc.theme` &#x2192; appended to `~/.config/dunst/dunstrc.active`
   - `neovim.lua` &#x2192; `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua`
4. Bakes accent/fg colors into SVG icon templates for the EWW bar
5. Sets the wallpaper from `backgrounds/`
6. Restarts/reloads all running apps:
   - EWW bar: kill + restart (re-compiles SCSS)
   - Hyprland: `hyprctl reload`
   - st/st-wl: OSC escape sequences (live, no restart)
   - Foot: `SIGUSR1`
   - Fish: sources `theme.fish` in all running sessions
   - Tide prompt: `tide reload` (updates git, pwd, vi-mode segment colors)
   - Dunst: `dunstctl reload`
   - btop: `SIGUSR2`
   - Logseq: writes `preferences.json` (Logseq watches this file)
   - GTK: `gsettings` (dark/light mode)
   - Brave/Chromium: managed policy + flags file

### Opacity Architecture

Window opacity is controlled at two levels:

1. **Application level** -- st-wl has a compiled-in alpha patch. `DEFAULT_ALPHA` in `config.h` is set to `1.0` (fully opaque) so the terminal renders solid pixels. The `-A` flag can override this at launch.

2. **Compositor level** -- Hyprland window rules in `windows.conf` apply per-theme opacity:
   ```
   # All windows get the theme's default opacity
   windowrule = opacity $themeOpacityActive $themeOpacityInactive, match:class .*

   # Terminals get their own opacity (can be more or less transparent)
   windowrule = opacity $themeTermOpacityActive $themeTermOpacityInactive, match:class ^(terminal|com\.mitchellh\.ghostty)$

   # Media apps and fullscreen are always fully opaque
   windowrule = opacity 1.0 1.0, match:class ^(mpv|imv|vlc|firefox|chromium|brave)$
   ```

   Rule order matters -- **last match wins** in Hyprland. Terminal and media rules come after the generic rule to override it.
